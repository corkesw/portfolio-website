          My name is Stephen and I am a trainee full stack web developer based
          in the beautiful High Peak. I am currently studying at Northcoders in
          Manchester.
        </p>
        <p class="biography_text">
          Northcoders is intense, but the quality of the teaching is awesome and
          I have learned so much over the past months.
        </p>
        <p class="biography_text">
          Before changing career I was working in retail banking for NatWest
          Group. Prior to that I was working in hospitality - I've probably done
          every job you can imagine in a bar or restaurant! My experience has
          taught me so much about working at pace whilst delivering world-class
          service to the customer. An attitude that I intend to bring to my
          first developer role.
        </p>
        <p class="biography_text">
          There's information on the projects I have completed over on the
          projects page. When I'm not learning to code, I can be found wandering
          the hills with Obi!
