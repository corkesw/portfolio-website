    <p class="biography_text">My name is Stephen and I am a trainee full stack web developer based in the beautiful High Peak. I am currently studying at Northcoders in Manchester.
    </p>
    <p class="biography_text">Northcoders is intense, but the quality of the teaching is awesome and I have learned so much over the past months.</p>
    <p class="biography_text">Before changing career I was working in retail banking for NatWest Group. Prior to that I was working in hospitality - I've probably done every job you can imagine in a bar or restaurant! My experience has taught me so much about working at pace whilst delivering world-class service to the customer. An attitude that I intend to bring to my first developer role.</p>
    <p class="biography_text">There's information on the projects I have completed over on the projects page. When I'm not learning to code, I can be found wandering the hills with Obi!</p>
